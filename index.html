      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Rodrigo: Some roadblocks with git commands, other than that smooth sailing.</li>
         <li>Sergio: Introducing an API feature in a javascript code is not that easy. I struggled with several parts of the code until I watched carefully the video.</li>
         <li>Sergio: Making the API searchable is quite a challenge itself. I needed to go back and forth many times from webpage to c9 in order to verify that the queries were being correctly introduced. Like I mentioned before, the video is an incredible guide and helped me overcome this obstacle!</li>
         <li>Miguel: A few problems running the events, and merging branches.</li>
